While Pokémon Go was shaking the world in 2016 there were some of us too lazy to walk around finding Pokémon so we were
__(missing the point of the game)__ trying to make it all a bit easier. pokemon-helper-not was one of those apps that enabled you to
catch in the comfort of your home. It came in two flavours: CLI and Web-based (which was never completely finished). All of this was 
possible because in the beginning guys at niantic (company behind the game) were fighting unexpected tons of players overloading their servers
so dumping of ProtoBuf messages from an Android app and faking them was fun for PokéHacker Masters.

This helper made a heavy usage of a [PokeGOAPI-Java](https://github.com/karlonovak/PokeGOAPI-Java) which I also made some contributions to.
